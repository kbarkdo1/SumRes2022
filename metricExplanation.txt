For each of fifty iterations, the simulation records the number of firing events in the excitatory 
population. At the end of each set of fifty, it calculationes the firing rate of each population.
It uses the firing rates to compute the metric. By comparing to the previous metric, and a 
rolling sum of consecutive events, it checks to see if the metric has been above 0.4 for 
five consecutive cycles or below 0.4 for five consecutive cycles. When the metric reaches
five consecutive cycles in either case, the simulation records the firing rate, average voltage, and 
average threshold of the neurons in the previous winning population (which will be the opposite
of the current event, e.g. if the metric has just reached five consecutive negative rounds
we may assume that it has been in the positive domain, with the positive population as the 
previous winning population). Then, it tells the simulation to start recording data for the
new winning population (negative in this examples) until the metric has five the of opposing
measurements (the metric is greater than 0.4 for five rounds).
